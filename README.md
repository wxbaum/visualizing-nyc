# Visualizations of New York City
This project explores some of the data available on the NYC Open Data platform. All code is in Python and visualizations are created with Plotly. 

You can read the write-up here: https://medium.com/@anthonybaum/f7b4772e9518?sk=4a5e587612fe91a806adf8a2e0d3d086. That's a friend link so you won't need a Medium membership to read it.

The datasets are pulled by directly reading the file from the web or accessing an API. You won't need any credentials or separate data downloads.
